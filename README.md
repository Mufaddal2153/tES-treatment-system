# tES Treatment System

The tES Treatment System is an innovative project designed to assist doctors in the treatment of brain disorders using a dataset of electrodes targeting specific areas of the brain. This powerful system utilizes brain MRI images processed in Matlab to identify the optimal electrode placement for treatment. Built on Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery, the tES Treatment System incorporates doctor and patient logins, streamlining the treatment process and ensuring effective communication between medical professionals and patients.

## Key Features

- **Doctor and Patient Login:** The tES Treatment System provides secure login functionality for both doctors and patients, allowing them to access their respective dashboards and interact with the system's features.
- **Electrode Placement Assistance:** Leveraging the electrode dataset and brain MRI images, the tES Treatment System assists doctors in identifying the precise locations for electrode placement. This feature optimizes treatment accuracy and enhances patient outcomes.
- **Treatment Recommendations:** Based on the analysis of the electrode dataset and brain MRI images, the system provides doctors with treatment recommendations, guiding them on which electrodes to charge for effective patient care.
- **Communication and Collaboration:** The system facilitates seamless communication and collaboration between doctors and patients. Doctors can update treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and provide essential instructions, while patients can share their symptoms, ask questions, and receive ongoing support.

## Technologies Used

The tES Treatment System is built using the following technologies:

- **Python Flask:** The robust and flexible Python web framework that powers the system, providing a reliable foundation for its functionality.
- **HTML:** The standard markup language for structuring the system's web pages, ensuring proper organization and visual coherence.
- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are utilized to enhance the visual aesthetics and presentation of the system, creating a professional and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript/JQuery:** JavaScript and JQuery add interactivity and dynamic elements to the system, improving usability and responsiveness.
